# Class and object
# Instance and static data/methods
# everything is an object in python - int, string, float, boolean, even functions!!!
# python supports multiple inheritance!!!
# pyton also supports abstract class
# python has polymorphism but only using duck typing
# There are NO support for interfaces in python (need to use abstract classes only)

# In python a single file is part of module and not class.
# a python file can contain multiple classes

class Book:
    pass


book1 = Book()
book2 = Book()

print(book1)
print(book2)
